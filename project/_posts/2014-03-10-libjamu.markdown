LibJamu was develop for the prototype [GenSession: A Flexible Zoomable Interface for Melody Generation]({% post_url 2014-02-24-gensession %}).
I decided to improve and re-use this library to support a new melody generator called [MURAL]({% post_url 2014-03-09-mural %}).

The next step will be to write the javadoc. I think this library could be very powerful to write music tool needed music theory algorithm.

**There is two modules**

  * `midi:com.cabrol.francois.libjamu.midi` - Midi library with a simple midi player
  * `musictheory:com.cabrol.francois.libjamu.musictheory` - Music theory library
