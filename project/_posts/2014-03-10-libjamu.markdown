## What's LibJaMu?

The idea to create LibJamu is from my master thesis and the conception of the prototype [GenSession: A Flexible Zoomable Interface for Melody Generation]({% post_url 2014-02-24-gensession %}).
After this work, I decided to create this library to support the development of a new melody generator called [MURAL]({% post_url 2014-03-09-mural %}).

The next step will be to write the javadoc. I think this library could be very powerful to write music tool needed music theory algorithm.

All of this is work in progress.
