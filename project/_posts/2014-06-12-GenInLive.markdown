### Why GenInLive? 
GenInLive is a prototype that allow to generate melody on a pre-defined chord progression and scales, in real time. The user can modify parameters during the generation and listen the result.

I was curious to test a similar application that is why I developed it. The result is pretty  good for a little prototype and I got satisfaction with it.

That's user experience give me motivation to start the development of [MURAL]({% post_url 2014-03-09-mural %}).

This prototype is developed with Java, the native library Java.Sound and the graphic library JavaFX.
