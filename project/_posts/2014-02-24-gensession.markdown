## What's GenSession?
The system allow the user to generate melodies, organize them, manage generation parameters and construct a midi music sequence without music knowledge. 

You can try it! No inspiration is required ;)
And luckily there is a [web page]({{page.website}}) that explains all about it!

The projet was done for my master thesis in the lab of <a href="http://profs.etsmtl.ca/mmcguffin/">Michael McGuffin</a>. The video that follow show how it works.

You can also download my master thesis (written in French) at [http://espace.etsmtl.ca/1278/](http://espace.etsmtl.ca/1278/).
