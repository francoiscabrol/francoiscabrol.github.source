###Why MURAL?

Experiment!
Because I developed a similar algorithm for my master thesis. The old version was developed in Java and it was a part of a project called [GenSession: A Flexible Zoomable Interface for Melody Generation]({% post_url 2014-02-24-gensession %}). For my thesis, the focus was on the interface. Java was not the best language to design this kind of algorithm, but good enough to get something working well. The goal of MURAL is to create a better generator, experiment new techniques to get better melody curves, developed in a functional language and re-use the java music library that I developed for GenSession.
