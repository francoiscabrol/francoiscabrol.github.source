### Why Localism?
A mouse replacement system using leap motion and based on a screen calibration tool.
The first idea was to create a mouse replacement system based on an home-made screen calibration system.
Now, I'd like to get localism work better and transform it in a simple screen calibration library for the leap Motion.

Please visit the [github repository](https://github.com/francoiscabrol/localism) to learn more.
